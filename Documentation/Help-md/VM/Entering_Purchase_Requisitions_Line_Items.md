Entering Purchase Requisitions Line Items




# Entering Purchase Requisitions Line Items

After entering general information in the header section
and tabs, begin adding line items to the purchase requisition.

1. Click the Insert
   Row button on the table toolbar to add a new line to the
   requisition.

VISUAL adds a new row to the table and assigns
it a line number.

The first column you select and the tab
movement between columns depends on your configuration of the line
item table. The procedures described below apply to columns in standard
order. In many cases, order of entry is not important.

2. If you are requisitioning
   an inventory part, double-click the Part ID
   column header.

| POSTIT.gif | Purchase Requisition Entry allows you to enter parts that are currently in the PART table of the database. If you enter an unrecognized part, VISUAL displays a warning message (Part id does not exist) and does not allow you to continue. |

A Part Browse dialog box appears.

You have the following browse options:

Part ID - Select
this option button to view a list of all parts in the database by
ID.

Part Description
- Select this option button to view a list of all parts in the database
by description

Parts supplied by current
vendor - Select this option button to display all parts the
selected vendor carries. This selection is not available until you
enter a vendor. The same Part ID can be listed multiple times in the
browse table. A Part ID is listed more than once if multiple Vendor
Part IDs are associated with the same part, or if you have approved
multiple vendor RFQs for the same Part ID.

Vendors supplying Current
Part - Select this option button to view a list of vendors
that carry the part. You cannot use this selection until you specify
a Part ID.

The Vendors Supplying Current Part option
does not select a new Part ID, but instead selects a vendor from among
those that supply the part. When you use this option, the Vendor ID
and all PO vendor information can change. If this happens, VISUAL
requests confirmation. The Vendor Part ID, U/M, and Unit Price on
the line item all set or reset to the new vendors values.

If you enter a Part ID for
a part that has a preferred vendor, and you have not previously entered
a Vendor ID for the purchase order, the Vendor ID and information
for the preferred vendor is automatically used.

The same vendor can be listed multiple times
in the browse table. A vendor is listed more than once if multiple
Vendor Part IDs are associated with the part or if you have approved
multiple vendor RFQs for the part.

3. Where applicable, enter
   information in the following columns.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| POSTIT.gif | Due to different line item table configurations, the order or availability of columns may be different in your window. You are not required to supply a value for each column.  Also, this table shares many field with the Purchase Order Entry window. Because the successful outcome of a requisition is a purchase order, VISUAL allows you to supply information based on the eventuality of the requisition becoming a actual purchase order. |

Quantity - The
quantity of the material or service you are requisitioning.

<Service ID>
- The ID of the service you are requisitioning. Double-click the <Service
ID> column header to choose from a list of contracted services.

<Vendor ID>
- Double-click the <Vendor ID> column
header to select the vendor from whom you are ordering the material
or service. You can specify a vendor at the header level and a vendor
per line, even though you might want to enforce a limit of one master
Vendor ID per requisition.

Vendor Part ID
- If the vendor maintains a different ID for the part, enter it into
the Vendor Part ID field. VISUAL auto-fills this field if the vendor
specified in the header is the preferred vendor of the part. VISUAL
obtains this information from the part master.

<Warehouse ID>
- By default, VISUAL auto-fills each line with the Warehouse ID specified
in the header. To change warehouses, double-click the <Warehouse
ID> column header.

Like Vendor Part ID, if the preferred vendor is specified in the header,
VISUAL auto-fills this field with the part manufacturers ID for the

Receive Date -
If you know the date on which you expect to receive the purchase order,
enter it into the Receive Date field.

Unit Price - If
the vendor supplying the part has a price break quantity plan in effect,
VISUAL auto-fills this field with the unit price according to the
quantity of the line. Absent a preferred vendor unit price, VISUAL
uses the price from the part master.

Note: Unit price
modifications may result in the total value of the requisition changing.
If the Preparer is bound by a dollar maximum (for example, $1,000),
VISUAL may disallow the save.

Discount % - If
applicable, enter a discount percent for the part quantity. Discounts
apply per line.

piece-tracked part, VISUAL obtains the default Dim UM from the part
master and auto-fills this field.

Line Status -
VISUAL allows you to specify a status per line in addition to a header
status. After all tasks for a requisition are completed and the requisition
is cleared to become a purchase order, the status of lines are adjusted
accordingly. After a requisition is approved (status "Approved"),
VISUAL prevents further status changes, on both the header and line
level.
